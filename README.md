Simple application for calculating BMI and weekly weight loss plan via counting calories

This was a solo 2-day sprint project. I wanted to make an easy and quick app to find your BMI and BMR. I also added the ability to look up calories burned during specific activities. I used RapidAPI(https://rapidapi.com/malaaddincelik/api/fitness-calculator) for the calculators and Canva(https://www.canva.com/) for the color scheme.
